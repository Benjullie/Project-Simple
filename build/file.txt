There are few things I would like you know about selecting a life partner.
Kindly read through and be informed:
1.  Both of you must have the same value systems.
2.  Both of you must not agree on everything.
3.  Both of you must have trust for each other. None must leave the back door open, else, one will use it someday.
There are more, but let these sink in for the moment.

Thank you...
